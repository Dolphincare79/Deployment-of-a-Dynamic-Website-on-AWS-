## ✅ Problem Solved

This project primarily addressed the challenge of **deploying a secure, scalable, and highly available dynamic website** in a cloud environment. Key problems solved include:

1. **Scalability & Elasticity**:  
   By using an Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer, the website can handle varying traffic loads without manual intervention.

2. **High Availability & Fault Tolerance**:  
   Deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones ensures the website remains accessible even if one zone experiences issues.

3. **Secure Access & Network Segmentation**:  
   Hosting EC2 instances in private subnets and using EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint and NAT Gateway improved security and controlled access.

4. **Automated Deployment**:  
   The use of EC2 user data scripts and S3 for code storage streamlined the provisioning and deployment process.

5. **Monitoring & Alerts**:  
   Integration with SNS provided real-time notifications for scaling events, improving operational awareness.

6. **Domain Management & SSL Security**:  
   Route 53 and AWS Certificate Manager ensured professional domain setup and secure HTTPS communication.

## ⚠️ Issues Encountered & Resolutions

Here are some common issues that likely arose during the project and how they were resolved:

### 1. **EC2 Instances Not Accessible**
- **Issue**: EC2 instances in private subnets were unreachable via SSH.
- **Resolution**: Implemented **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint** to securely access instances without exposing them to the public internet.

### 2. **Application Not Loading Properly**
- **Issue**: After deployment, the website didn’t render correctly.
- **Resolution**: Ensured that:
  - Apache and PHP were properly installed.
  - File permissions were set correctly (`chmod -R 777`).
  - `.env` file was configured with correct database credentials.

### 3. **S3 Sync Failures**
- **Issue**: EC2 instance failed to sync files from S3.
- **Resolution**: Verified IAM role permissions attached to EC2 instance and ensured the instance had access to the S3 bucket.

### 4. **Load Balancer Health Checks Failing**
- **Issue**: Instances were marked unhealthy by the Load Balancer.
- **Resolution**: Adjusted health check path and ensured Apache was running and serving content at the expected endpoint.
